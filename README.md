# 7-GUIs-in-Bogue
7-GUIs-in-Bogue is a project that implements the 7GUIs tasks using the Bogue library in OCaml programming language. These tasks serve as a GUI programming usability benchmark.

## Introduction
The 7-GUIs-in-Bogue repository aims to demonstrate how to create simple graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using Bogue. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of GUI development, such as buttons, input fields, and more.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/IdaraNabuk/7-GUIs-in-Bogue.git
- Install Bogue (if not already installed).
- Navigate to the task directories (e.g., Counter, etc.) and explore the Bogue code.

## Task Implementations
The repository contains the following task implementations:

**Task 1**: Counter: A simple counter with increment and decrement buttons.

**Task 2**: Temperature Converter: Convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

**Task 3**: Flight Booker: Select departure and return dates. This is not yet fully implemented.

**Task 4**: Timer: Start, stop, and reset a timer. There's still room for improvement.

**Task 5**: CRUD: Create, read, update, and delete items. This is not yet fully implemented.

**Task 6**: Circle Drawer: Draw circles on a canvas.

**Task 7**: Cells: Create a simple but usable spreadsheet application.


- To see the examples in display, navigate to the particular example directory and run the code:
dune exec ./bin/main.exe
